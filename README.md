Hello, we are Year 1 CS Students from NTU! Welcome to our project for the course : Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 

Our project is based on IMDB 5000 dataset found on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset

We wonder, "If we were movie directors, how could we maximise our success rates?" 

We define the success of a movie based on its imdb_rating, popularity (movie_facebook_likes & num_user_for_reviews)
