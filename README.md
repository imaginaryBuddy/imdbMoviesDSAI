Hello, we are Year 1 CS Students from NTU! welcome to our project for the course : Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 

Our project is based on IMDB 5000 dataset found on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset

We would like to ask: If we were movie directors, how can we maximise our success rates? 

We define the success of a movie based on its imdb_rating, gross and num_of_reviews(popularity)
